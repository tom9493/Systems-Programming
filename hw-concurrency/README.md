# Concurrency

The purpose of this assignment is to give you hands-on experience with
concurrency.  Code is provided for an echo server that listens for clients to
connect over a TCP connection (socket of type `SOCK_STREAM`) and echoes back
their messages, one line at a time, until they disconnect.  You will experiment
with that code and analyze what it is doing.


# Preparation

 1. Read the following in preparation for this assignment:
    - Sections 12.1 and 12.3 - 12.5 in the book
    - The man pages for the following:
      - `pthreads`
      - `sem_init()`
      - `sem_wait()`
      - `sem_post()`

 2. Run `make` to build four servers: `echoserveri`, `echoserverp`,
    `echoservert`, and `echoservert_pre`.  These are versions of the echo
    server that use, respectively, no concurrency, process-based (using
    `fork()`) concurrency, simple thread-based concurrency (threads created on
    the fly), and thread-based concurrency using a thread-pool.

 3. Start a tmux session with five panes open.  You are welcome to arrange them
    however you want, but it might be easiest to do it something like this:

    ```
    -------------------------------------
    | client 1  | client 2  | client 3  |
    -------------------------------------
    |             server                |
    -------------------------------------
    |            analysis               |
    -------------------------------------
    ```

 4. You will be doing a writeup on this assignment.


# Part 1: No Concurrency

Start the `echoserveri` server in the "server" pane using the following command line:

```bash
$ ./echoserveri port
```
(Replace `port` with a port of your choosing, an integer between 1024 and
65535.  Use of ports with values less than 1023 require root privileges).

In each of the three "client" panes run the following:

```bash
$ nc localhost port
```
(Replace `port` with the port on which the server program is now listening.)

`localhost` is a domain name that always refers to the local system.  This is
used in the case where client and server are running on the same system.


After all three are running, type some text in the first of the three "client"
panes, and press enter.  Repeat with the second and third "client" panes.
In the "analysis" pane run the following:

```bash
$ ps -Lo user,pid,ppid,nlwp,lwp,state,ucmd -C echoserveri | grep ^username\\\|USER
```
(Replace `username` with your actual username)

The `ps` command lists information about processes that currently exist on the
system.  The `-L` option tells us to show threads ("lightweight processes") as
if they were processes.  The `-o` option is used to show only the following
fields:

 - user: the username of the user running the process
 - pid: the process ID of the process
 - ppid: the process ID of the parent process
 - nlwp: the number of threads (light-weight processes) being run
 - lwp: the thread ID of the thread
 - state: the state of the process, e.g., Running, Sleep, Zombie
 - ucmd: the command executed.

While some past homework assignments required you to use the `ps` command without
a pipeline (e.g., to send its output grep), `ps` has the shortcoming that it
can't simultaneously filter by both command name and user, so the above command
line is a workaround.

 1. Show the output from the `ps` command.

 2. From the `ps` output, how many processes and how many threads are running,
    and why?  Use the PID and LWP to identify different threads or processes.

 3. Enter `Ctrl`+`c` on the pane in which `nc` was first executed to interrupt
    it.  What happens to the `nc` processes in the other windows?

Stop the server by using `ctrl`+`c` in the appropriate pane.


# Part 2: Process-based Concurrency

Repeat the exercises from Part 1 (except question 3), replacing all instances
of `echoserveri` with `echoserverp`, including in the `ps` command.  Answer
questions 1 and 2 for `echoserverp` as questions 4 and 5.


# Part 3: Simple Thread-based Concurrency

Repeat the exercises from Part 1 (except question 3), replacing all instances
of `echoserveri` with `echoservert`, including in the `ps` command.  Answer
questions 1 and 2 for `echoservert` as questions 6 and 7.


# Part 4: Threadpool-based Concurrency

Repeat the exercises from Part 1 (except question 3), replacing all instances
of `echoserveri` with `echoservert_pre`, including in the `ps` command.  Answer
questions 1 and 2 for `echoservert_pre` as questions 8 and 9.


# Part 5: Producer-Consumer Review

Modify `echoservert_pre.c` by sandwiching the line containing the `accept()`
statement between the following two print statements:

```c
printf("before accept()\n"); fflush(stdout);
// accept() goes here...
printf("after accept()\n"); fflush(stdout);              
```

Open `sbuf.c`, and put similar `printf()` statements around the following lines:
 - `sem_wait(&sp->slots);`
 - `sem_post(&sp->items);`
 - `sem_wait(&sp->items);`
 - `sem_post(&sp->slots);`
(You will need to add `#include <stdio.h>`.)

Run `make` again, then start the server in the "server" pane:
```bash
$ ./echoservert_pre port
```
(Replace `port` with a port of your choosing.)

Use the output and the code itself to answer the following questions.

 10. How many producer threads are running?

 11. How many consumer threads are running?

 12. What is the producer thread waiting on?

 13. What are the consumer threads waiting on?

In one of the "client" panes run the following:

```bash
$ nc localhost port
```
(Replace `port` with the port on which the server program is now listening.)

 14. What event changes the state of the producer (i.e., so it is no longer
     waiting)?

 15. What event changes the state of the consumer(s)?

 16. How many consumers change state?

 17. What event changes the state of the consumer(s)? (this question was accidentally a repeat of 15 :))

 18. What is the producer thread now waiting on?



Answer the following questions, considering the three concurrency models
examined in this assignment: processed-based (`echoserverp`); thread-based with
spawning threads on-the-fly (`echoservert`); and threadpool-based
(`echoservert_pre`).  You may use your own observations and/or refer to the book
(e.g., section 12.1.2).


 19. Rank the terms in decreasing (most expensive to least expensive) order of
     run-time cost for handling a given client.

 20. Which (one or more) of the three, as implemented in this assignment,
     has/have an explicit limitation in terms of number of clients that can be
     handled concurrently?

 21. Which (one or more) of the three of the models allow(s) allow sharing of
     memory and data structures without the use of inter-process communication
     (e.g., pipes, sockets)?

 22. Which (one or more) of the three of the models seems to be the least
     complex to implement?
