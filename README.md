# Systems Programming
These are all the homeworks and projects I completed during my systems programming class, all done in c. Some concepts implemented here are:

*Commonly used c functions such as fork and exec
*Signals and job control
*sockets
*concurrency
*openMP
*virtual memory
*shells
*pipelines and redirection
*HTTP proxies/servers
*threadpools
*I/O multiplexing
*host vs network byte order
*TLS protocols
*and a host of other concepts related to coding in c (string manipulation, structs, pointers, bit flipping, etc.)

The repository on Operating Systems Design takes these concepts further...
